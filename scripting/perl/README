README - 04/11/2003
-------------------

The README is used to introduce the module and provide
instructions on how to install the module, any machine
dependencies it may have (for example C compilers and installed
libraries) and any other information that should be provided
before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts
the README file from a module distribution so that people
browsing the archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses.
It is usually a good idea to provide version information here so
that people can decide whether fixes for the module are worth
downloading.
