README.pdftops - 05/02/2002
------------------------------

In the standard CUPS distribution this directory contains the pdftops or xpdf
filter. For MacOS X Apple uses a replacement filter called cgpdftops. Replace
the contents of this directory with the one from CUPS if you want to use the
xpdf converter.
